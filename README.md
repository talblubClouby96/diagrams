# Diagrams

**Diagram as Code**.

Diagrams lets you to draw the cloud system architecture **in Python code**. It was born for **prototyping** a new system architecture design without any design tools. You can also describe or visualize the existing system architecture as well. Diagrams currently supports three major cloud providers: `AWS`, `Azure`, `GCP`.

**Diagram as Code** also allows you to **tracking** the architecture diagram changes on any **version control** system.

>  NOTE: It does not control any actual cloud resources like cloudformation or terraform, but just for drawing the cloud system architecutrre diagram.

```shell
$ pip install diagrams
```
